What are Cookies?
Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields −

Expires − The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.

Domain − The domain name of your site.

Path − The path to the directory or web page that set the cookie. This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.

Secure − If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server. If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.

Name=Value − Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key-value pairs
